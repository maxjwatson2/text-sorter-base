# text-sorter-base

This is a simple application that sorts text files seperated with either commas, pikes, or spaces into a readable format. 

## Installation

Download from http://example.com/FIXME.

## Usage

Start up a repl and call the (start-server) function in text-sorter-base.rest. This will start the server. Go to http://localhost:3000/ . If you see the phrase "Lets sort some records of people out!" then the server is up. Going to http://localhost:3000/records/populate will return a page that says "POPULATED" and put some prefabricated data into the the temporary database. Going to http://localhost:3000/records/email http://localhost:3000/records/name and http://localhost:3000/records/birthdate will allow you to see properly returned records in the web browser.

### Bugs

This is only for demonstration purposes so there maybe a few bugs. If we want to increase stability we can download a library called cloverage which will show exactly what our tests cover and give us a percentage readout.
